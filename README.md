## Program's Features

### Vector Calculation

* Add Vectors

* Multiply Vector with scalar and vector

* Dot Product, Cross Product

* Project a vector on another

* Find area of parrallelogram under two vectors

### Extra Feature that help visualizing

* Import Vector Data from and Export to Files

* Set Number Precision (Number of digits after decimal point)

### Very Good Memory Management

  There is almost no memory leak in this program from testing so far.

* Tested using valgrind, however, some very small leaks are possible in rare case.

* Only applies on English Version

### Multilingual

* Support 3 Languages: English, Thai and Japanese

 __Note__: In Thai and Japanese Version, Import/Export Vector and setting Number Precision is unstable. Please avoid using them.

## How to Run Program

  Compile the source code and done!

  To use import/export function, VectorSave Folder must be in the same directory.

## Sample Vector Data to start with

  I've already put some sample vector data you can play with!

  These are generated using ```numpy```.

  Note: Use Import Vector Function to import them, but please avoid using them in TH,JP Version as it is unstable.

## Compatibility

Support both Windows and UNIX OS.

Compiler : C99 or above

Note : Thai and Japanese Version aren't supported in UNIX OS.

Note : ```-lm``` (Math Library) must be manually attached when compiling in UNIX OS.

  The result of this project is really satisfying! üëç

### Further Development : Version 2

  Developing alone with help from
  @Teproanyx, including his Safe Input Module. Big Thanks to him! üòä

  Also thank you to stackoverflow.

### Version 3 Development

  Developed further more to submit to T.Wichai again as improvement project.

  Note : Due to outgoing pandemic, there is no more work group.
   (For social distancing) So this work will done my me alone.
