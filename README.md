* Multiply Vector with scalar and vector

* Dot Product, Cross Product

* Project a vector on another

* Find area of parrallelogram under two vectors

### Extra Feature that help visualizing

* Import Vector Data from and Export to Files

* Set Number Precision (Number of digits after decimal point)

### Very Good Memory Management

  There is almost no memory leak in this program from testing so far.

* Tested using valgrind, however, some very small leaks are possible in rare case.

* Exclude Thai and Japanese Version on Windows

### Multilingual

## üî¢ Sample Vector Data to start with

  I've already put some sample vector data you can play with!

  These are generated using ```numpy```.

  Note: Use Import Vector Function to import them, but please avoid using them in TH,JP Version as it is unstable.

  The result of this project is really satisfying! üëç

### Further Development : Version 2

  Developing alone with help from
  @Teproanyx, including his Safe Input Module. Big Thanks to him! üòä

  Also thank you to stackoverflow.

### Version 3 Development

  Developed further more to submit to T.Wichai again as improvement project.
